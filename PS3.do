/* Not all data points did a merge of both sets. Going through the names of those which did not, these entities are a combination of education commissions, vocational schools, and regional districts which do not serve students at the 4th grade level (i.e. upper level districts) and thus do not have testing data. Each merge had the same 100 points for this. Holding on to these points for now, but will probably split into a separated set to just have "full" i.e. k-12 districts for more homogenous analysis of the "typical" school district. */
