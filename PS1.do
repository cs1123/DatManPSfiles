* Some Basic Descriptives & Data Layout 

* Total Students are important for future analyses 

hist member08

* Most districts fall within 0 to couple thousand students; few outliers over 10k, with a few between 20-40k (cities) 

* Total number of teachers are important for future analyses 

hist tottch08

* Most districts fall within having a few hundred teachers or less. A few outliers with over 1k and the most between 2-3k. 

* Scatter Plot for total students and total teachers to show distribution trends 

scatter (member08 tottch08)

* Tight grouping in districts with smaller totall students. Spread of total teachers becomes wider as student-base becomes larger.
